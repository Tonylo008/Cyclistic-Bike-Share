This is the final project of the Google Data Analyitcs Certificate Program. I used Excel and Pivot Tables to analize this data. In this repository is a Power Point presentation of the data analysis I did with this project. In this project I looked at data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company in Chicago, IL. I used data from Divy Trip that spans from January 2024 - December 2024. Below is a link to Divy Trip where you can see the data.
